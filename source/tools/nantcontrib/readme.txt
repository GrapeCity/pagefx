NAntContrib

What is it?
-----------
NAntContrib is the project for tasks and tools that haven't made it into the main NAnt distribution 
yet or for whatever reason don't belong there.


How to use NAntContrib tasks in NAnt?
-------------------------------------
In order to use NAntContrib tasks in NAnt, you can use one of the following procedures:

1. Use the <loadtasks> task in your build file(s) to tell NAnt which assembly to scan for tasks

For example:

<project name="NAntContrib" default"test">
    <target name="test">
        <loadtasks assembly="c:/nantcontrib-0.85/bin/NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.dll" />
        ...
    </target>
</project>

In order to avoid updating all build files when you move the NAnt.Contrib.Tasks assembly to another
directory, you could register the directory containing the NAnt.Contrib.Tasks assembly in an 
environment variable and then use the value of that environment variable in your build files.

For example:

<project name="NAntContrib" default"test">
    <target name="test">
        <loadtasks assembly="${path::combine(environment::get-variable('NANTCONTRIB_DIR'), 'bin/NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.dll')}" />
        ...
    </target>
</project>

This example assumes you've registered an environment variable named "NANTCONTRIB_DIR", holding the 
path to NAntContrib (eg. c:\nantcontrib-0.85).


2. Copy the content of the NAntContrib bin directory to the NAnt directory

In order to make certain tasks available to every build file, you can copy the tasks assembly and 
all its non-assembly dependencies to the "<nant>\bin\tasks" directory, and copy the assembly 
dependencies to the "<nant>\bin\lib" directory.

However, as NAntContrib contains tasks that rely on COM Interop, it is only supported on the .NET
Framework (not on Mono). So, in order to avoid issues when running NAnt on Mono, you should copy
the content of the NAntContrib bin directory to "<nant>\bin\tasks\net" and "<nant>\bin\lib\net". 
This will ensure that NAnt only loads the NAntContrib tasks when running on one of the MS .NET 
Framework runtimes.

You should eventually end up with the following directory structure:

<nant>\
    bin\
        lib\
            net\
                CollectionGen.dll
                Interop.MsmMergeTypeLib.dll
                Interop.StarTeam.dll
                Interop.WindowsInstaller.dll
                SourceSafe.Interop.dll

        tasks\
            net\
                MSITaskErrors.mst
                MSITaskTemplate.msi
                MSMTaskErrors.mst
                MSMTaskTemplate.msm
                NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.dll
                NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.pdb (not available for releases)
                NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.xml

        SLiNgshoT.Core.dll
        SLiNgshoT.exe

Note: you might have to manually create the "tasks\net" and "lib\net" directories.


3. Modify NAnt configuration file (not recommended)

An <include> element can be added to the <task-assemblies> node in the <framework> node for the
.NET Framework version that you intend to use. The "name" attribute of the <include> element 
should hold the absolute path to NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.dll.

For example:

    <framework 
            name="net-1.1" 
                family="net" 
                version="1.1"
                description="Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1"
        ....
    >
            <task-assemblies>
            ...
            <include name="c:/nantcontrib-0.85/bin/NAnt.Contrib.Tasks.dll" />
            ...
                </task-assemblies>
        ....
    </framework>

You would need to repeat this for all .NET Framework versions that you intend to use.

Note: The NAnt configuration file (NAnt.exe.config) is considered internal, and might change without
      noticed.


How to build.
-------------
To build NAntContrib, the following procedure should be followed:


1. Download and extract a binary distribution of NAnt from http://nant.sourceforge.net

2. Change to the NAntContrib directory

3. Run NAntContrib.build using the version of NAnt that you downloaded

    eg.  c:\NAnt-0.85\bin\NAnt.exe -D:nant.dir=c:\NAnt -f:NAntContrib.build

Note: 

These instructions only apply to the source distribution of NAntContrib, as the binary distribution 
contains pre-built assemblies.
