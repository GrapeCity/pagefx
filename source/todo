===== Compiler Improvements =====

1. CodeCachingService

1.1. Save in ABC method body refs on compiler generated methods (casting)

1.2. Minimize ABZ format to make loading faster. Use constant pools.

[+] 2. Caching type names

3. [case 124488] Building reachibility relations between basic blocks during construction phase of control flow graph

4. Cache info of Control Flow Graph analysis to reuse it in further compilation of given method (generic context).
   For example, cache insertion points for call receivers.

5. Implement Code Sharing mechanism for generic instances and generic methods

6. [case 123143] Prepare pfc to enable compiling assemblies to RSLs

===== Runtime Optimizations =====

1. Redundant Copy Elimination (RCE) - elimination of pfx.__copy__ operations
   after conversion of 64-bit integers or decimal numbers.

2. Implement copy propagation optimization.

===== Research =====

1. Look at gnash tools. Try.
2. Look at Adobe Alchemy. Look at ABC files generated by Alchemy compiler.


===== Misc Tasks =====

1. Allow starting debug session of swf file without debugging info
2. Try use 'construct' instruction on objects (for initialization of given object)
3. For Root Sprite parameterless ctor must always be compiled as initializer (even with /refl switch)
4. Calc IsExposed property for ITypeMember in assembly loading phase.
5. Test casting between jagged arrays.
