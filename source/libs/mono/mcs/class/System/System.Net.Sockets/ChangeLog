	355473.

2007-11-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs : in 2.0 Close() is not needed and does not exist.

2007-11-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Socket.cs: Do not set the Send and Receive buffer sizes for the
	socket to the defaults set on Windows, they kill our performance.

	Thanks to Zoltan Varga for tracking the performance issue down.
	The bug was #325032

2007-10-30  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	Fixes bug 81985.

2007-05-16 Adar Wesley <adarw@mainsoft.com>

	* Socket.jvm.cs: added missing methods EndDisconnect, IOControl,
	Send 2.0 overloads, Receive 2.0 overloads, ReceiveMessageFrom,
	BeginReceiveMessageFrom, EndReceiveMessageFrom, 
	EndAccept 2.0 overloads, BeginSend, EndSend, BeginReceive,

2007-03-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TcpClient.cs: Do not initialize network stream in Connect. In
	Dispose, only nullify client if network stream was not obtained.
	Fixes bug #81105.

2007-01-30  Ilya Kharmatsky <ilyak -at- mainsoft.com>

	* Socket.jvm.cs: additional stubs for net_2_0 properties,
	bug fixes (EnsureStillUsable method inserted)

	* Socket.jvm.cs: added stubs for net_2_0 properties and methods.

2007-01-26  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: SupportsIPv6 is obsolete in the 2.0 profile.  Stub
	out BeginReceiveMessageFrom(), BeginSendFile(),
	EndReceiveMessageFrom(), EndSendFile(), ReceiveMessageFrom(), and
	SendFile().

	* IPPacketInformation.cs: New in the 2.0 profile

	* SocketFlags.cs: Remove useless (and empty) inline documentation,
	and add 2.0 items.

	* TcpListener.cs: Mark Server as public in the 2.0 profile.

	* UdpClient.cs: Mark Dispose(bool) as protected in the 2.0
	profile.

	System.Net.Sockets should now be 2.0-complete.

2007-01-26  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: There's no point checking the SO_ERROR status of a
	socket after poll() or select() if we already know that connected
	== true.

2007-01-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* IOControlCode.cs: 
	* SocketInformationOptions.cs:

	Kulkarni (sridharkulkarni@gmail.com)

2007-01-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Socket.cs: Move the throw new NotImplementedException ()
	elsewhere to prevent Moma reports.

2007-01-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs(SocketDefaults): Catch and ignore any SocketExceptions
	thrown from setting default socket options - some platforms might
	not support a particular default we're trying to set.

2007-01-11  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* IOControlCode.cs: 
	* SocketInformation.cs:

	(sridharkulkarni@gmail.com)

Wed Dec 13 12:04:02 CET 2006 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: stub ReceiveBufferSize and SendBufferSize to
	get ironpython to compile.

2006-11-23  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Only set Connected = true in Poll() and Select() if
	the socket error status is 0.  Fixes bug 79878.

2006-09-28 Andrew Skiba <andrews@mainsoft.com>

	* Socket.cs,NetworkStream.cs,SocketException.cs: TARGET_JVM

	values. When ReceiveTimeout is set on a blocking socket, correctly
	report timeouts in the generated exception.
	
	* SocketException.cs: add new internal ctor (int, string).

2006-08-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Socket.cs (NoDelay): Implement.

2006-06-30 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: patch from Sanghyeon Seo that implements
	(Send|Receive)Timeout for 2.0.
	* MulticastOption.cs: more 2.0 stuff.

2006-06-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs : use ConfigurationManager.GetSection() under NET_2_0.
	  Also make sure to avoid NRE.

2006-06-24  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Socket.cs: Add stubs for net 2.0 SendTimeout and ReceiveTimeout properties.

2006-04-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs:
	* SocketError.cs: implemented Reseive/Send overloads that do not throw
	in case of error. Patch by Tomi Valkeinen.

2006-03-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs (Dispose): Use the right signature depending on
	the profile being built.

2006-03-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: pass something not empty to the unixep ctor.

2006-03-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: Fix IPv6 family check.  Fixes bug 77689.

2006-02-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: when the socket is not connected, don't try to set the
	socket options, as they are ignored on linux. Wait until Connect
	succeeds and then apply the options.

2006-02-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added a missing overload for SetSocketOption.

2006-01-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: use the 2.0 configuration classes when checking for IPv6
	support.

2006-01-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: The Client property is public in 2.0 while it was
	protected in earlier release. Fix bug #77048.

2005-12-07  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* SocketError.cs: Added.
	* SocketException: Implemented SocketErrorCode. Fixes bug #76915.

2005-10-11  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Don't call connect(2) twice for non-blocking sockets,
	it breaks on macos (and probably other bsd-based stacks too,) use
	poll() and getsockopt() to check if it worked.

2005-09-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: add checks for 'disposed' all over. Fixes bug #76249.

2005-06-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: patch by Hans Kratz that uses an integer when setting
	NoDelay instead of a bool, which is only handled in 2.0.

2005-06-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: disallow connecting to .Any addresses. Fixes bug #75154.

2005-06-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: adapted Select to the new Select_internal that uses poll()
	instead of select(). Managed part of the fix for bug #71203.

2005-05-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: apply the same hack on blocking Connect calls as the one
	used in Accept.

2005-05-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: see bug #74842, which is fixed with this patch for details
	and test cases on the blocking behavior of accept() when close() is
	called from another thread. The solution applied is to Abort the thread
	that is blocking in Accept_internal() when someone calls Close (), then
	reset the abort state if the socket is disposed and return the same
	error as MS (10004 - interrupted).

2005-05-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: match MS behavior on SetSocketOption with a boolean
	argument. MS 1.1 throws an ArgumentException, but 2.0 turns true/false
	into 1/0 and works fine. Fixes bug #71753. Added checks for disposed
	in the 3 SetSocketOption.

2005-05-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: if there are outstanding aio requests and one of them gets
	an ObjectDisposedException, throw the same exception for the rest.

2005-05-02 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: removed hack added to fix bug #53229 (more than a year ago)
	that kept sockets opened until all AIO operations where finished. If
	the socket is closed, Receive returns 0 in EndReceive, the rest throw
	the ObjectDisposedException. Set the socket handle to -1 when closing.

2005-04-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Begin/End Send/SendTo guarantee that all bytes are written
	or an exception is thrown. Fixes bug #74475.

2005-04-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: no need for locking in Worker. The actual read / write for
	Receive / Send is performed in the runtime time.

2005-04-15 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added a 'blocking' field that is passed to the runtime.

2005-04-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: invoke the callback after scheduling the next request for
	the socket. Fixes bug #74539.

2005-04-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: update socket connected status in an async request finishes
	synchronously. Use 'callback' instead of 'real_callback' field, which is
	now unused.

2005-04-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added SocketOperation enum and 2 new fields to
	SocketAsyncResult that are used by the runtime. Asynchronous read/write
	are serialized so that only 1 of each kind is really 'active'.
	Handle non-blocking connects in BeginConnect instead of doing 2 Poll()
	in the threadpool.

	* NetworkStream.cs: better message for the exception.

2005-04-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: remove unused async IO code.

2005-03-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: don't Poll/block in Connect aither.

2005-02-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: don't block on Accept if the socket is non-blocking.
	Fixes bug #73053. Patch by Ankit Jain.

2005-02-23  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: Set the Broadcast option, as apparently the MS
	runtime defaults make UDP sockets broadcastable.

2004-12-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: for Receive*/Send*, don't set the connected status to false
	when the error is EINPROGRESS or EWOULDBLOCK.

2004-12-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: Write should ensure that writes all the contents
	of the buffer. Fixes bug #70123. Besos para Miguelito.

2004-10-14  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs (Sockets ): Set Accept()ed socket blocking status to
	be the same as the listening socket.  This follows MS behaviour.

2004-08-04  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Update Connected state in Select and Poll; this is
	when we find out that non-blocking Connects succeed.  Fixes bug
	62398.

2004-07-28  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: ReceiveFrom might not return a valid EndPoint.  Patch
	by Nick Vaughan (dev@6wardlaw.freeserve.co.uk), fixes bug 61608.

2004-07-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Don't try and dereference a null array in Select()
	(possible if a descriptor list of length 0 was passed.)  Patch by
	Nick Vaughan (dev@6wardlaw.freeserve.co.uk), fixes bug 61595.

2004-07-12 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: if'ed RemoveReferences calls.

2004-07-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Slight tweak to allow unknown objects to be returned
	by GetSocketOption().

2004-06-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: connect on non-blocking sockets returns EINPROGRESS. Fixes
	bug #60811.

2004-06-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: wrong error code in connect and accept. EWOULDBLOCK is
	10035. Fixes bug #60563.

2004-06-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fixed Accept for non-blocking sockets.

2004-06-10  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LingerOption.cs: marked field private to fix API signature
	* MulticastOption.cs: marked field private to fix API signature

2004-06-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: throw ArgumentNullException if all the list are null OR
	empty. Fixes bug #59632.

2004-05-21  Patrik Torstensson <totte@hiddenpeaks.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: Fixes a lot of the problems with remoting nunit tests.
	
	(AcceptTcpClient): Don't create TcpClient before a
	connection is accepted.
	
	(LocalEndPoint): Use Server LocalEndPoint if connected
	otherwise use endpoint from ctor.
	
	(Init): Save end point, not server endpoint. This did
	cause TcpListener to ignore port sent via constructor.

	(Pending): Fixed wait time (method should return directly)
	
	(Start): Moved Bind here instead of Init method; old method
	caused us to bind ports even if the listener was stopped.
	
	(Stop): Null server when stopping

2004-05-13  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: 
	* TcpClient.cs: Public API fixes

2004-05-07  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fixed Connect for non-blocking sockets. Closes bug #58169.

2004-05-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fix for BeginConnect and non-blocking sockets.

2004-05-03  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Use assembly name const to load Mono.Posix.

2004-05-01  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: only enable socket AIO if MONO_ENABLE_SOCKET_AIO is there.
	I will remove this once THE bug is hunted.

2004-04-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added support for unmanaged asynchronous IO. Speed up
	error checking.
	* UdpClient.cs: fixed Dispose so that it only closes the socket when
	called explicitly.

2004-04-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added GetSupportsAsync and Poll_internal internal calls.
	Cleaned up Worker class: moved fields to SocketAsyncResult and use Poll
	when the socket is non-blocking before getting EWOULDBLOCK error.

2004-04-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Rearrange the internal calls so that the exceptions
	are thrown from managed code

2004-03-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: when Dispose (bool) is called from the finalizer, always
	do the cleanup. Fixes yet another nullref with xsp.

2004-02-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: implemented IOControl.

2004-02-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: use the threadpool for asynchronous calls instead of
	creating new threads.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added locks around waithandle assign and comparison in
	class Worker. Handle other exceptions than SocketException for
	non-blocking sockets.

2004-01-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: handle WSAEWOULDBLOCK for non-blocking sockets. Fixes
	bug #53168. Avoid the creation of the ManualResetEvent in class Worker
	whenever possible.

2004-01-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: if we have a pending async event, delay socket closing
	until EndX is called. Fixes bug #53229. Check parameters and if the
	socket has been disposed. Implemented IDisposable explicitly. The
	threads created have IsBackground = true now.

2004-01-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: patch from Brad Fitzpatrick <brad@danga.com> episode 2.

2003-12-30  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fix for several asynchronous methods to delay exception
	throwing.  Patch by Brad Fitzpatrick <brad@danga.com>.

2003-12-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: get the LocalEndPoint from the socket after binding.
	Fixes bug #52329.

2003-10-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: Fix void Dispose (bool disposing) to follow the
	pattern.  It was shutting down the managed resources even in the
	finalizer case, it should only do that when called from
	IDisposable.Dipose.

2003-09-11  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: Added [In,Out] attributes to Read method.

2003-08-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: various fixes to make the new tests pass. Closes
	bug #47848.

2003-08-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs (Receive): Fix Bug 45633;  We should do a blocking
	call until a datagram is arrives from the remote host.  This
	removes the 512 "magic" buffer size when we did not have any data.
 
2003-07-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs:
	* Socket.cs: fixed array boundary checks. 0 sized arrays are allowed.

2003-07-18  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* Socket.cs: Added GetHashCode method

2003-07-14  Jerome Laban <jlaban@wanadoo.fr>

	* Socket.cs:
	* ProtocolType.cs:
	* SocketOptionLevel.cs:
	* TcpListener.cs:
	* TcpClient.cs:
	* UdpClient.cs:
	
	Added IPv6 support.

	* IPv6MulticastOption.cs: Added for IPv6 support.

2003-05-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Use Mono.Posix.UnixEndPoint if its available

2003-05-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MulticastOption.cs: patch by Jerome Laban included in bug #42393.

2003-05-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs:
        (Select): don't create arrays if not needed.
        (Poll): call Select_internal directly.

	Warning: you need an up to date runtime for this to work!

2003-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: don't bind the socket unless .ctor (IPEndPoint) is used.
	Added more checks and throws.
	Small fixes in Send to avoid duplicating the buffer.
	Moved CheckIfDisposed calls to the start of the methods instead of doing
	the check inside a finally clause.

2003-03-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs:
	(SendTo): fix from Jerome Laban <jlaban@wanadoo.fr>.

2003-02-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: patch from Elan Feingold <efeingold@mn.rr.com>. Fixes
	NullReferenceException when the callback is null.

2003-02-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: allow 0 size array in Write.

2003-02-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: make Worker.Connect and Receive work with non-blocking
	sockets. May be Receive* and Send* in Worker need to do the same. I'll
	wait for bug reports. Set IsCompleted to true before invoking the end
	callback. Fixes bug #38136.

	* NetworkStream.cs: the check for disposed should not be done in the
	finally clause.

	* Socket.cs: Only close the socket in one place, ie the Dispose
	method.  Fixes bug 32054.

2002-11-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: offset == size == 0 it's ok in Send ().

2002-11-03  Phillip Pearson  <pp@myelin.co.nz>

	* TcpClient.cs: Fixed SetTcpClient() to pass through to the Client 
	property, which now sets stream to null (it's set by GetStream()).  This 
	should make GetStream() work on a TcpClient which has had the socket set 
	by assignment to the Client property, not only one that has been created 
	by TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient().

	* Socket.cs: 
	* NetworkStream.cs: Bounds checking fixes, and better exception
	texts.  Changes by timothyjmills@hotmail.com (Timothy J. Mills).

2002-08-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Fix deadlock when the AsyncResult callback calls
	End*().  Set the async request's worker property so it can return
	results.  These two fixes combined fix bug 28092.

2002-06-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Make SetSocketOption cope with boolean values (they
	are passed as objects, not the ints the runtime was expecting)

2002-05-17  Lawrence Pit <loz@cable.a2000.nl>
 	* TcpListener.cs: Renamed LocalEndPoint to LocalEndpoint
	* NetworkStream.cs, UdpClient.cs and TcpClient.cs: modified disposable 
	routines, added	checks for disposed state.
	* UdpClient.cs: commented out GetHashCode and Equals as it's not
	overriden in ms.net implementation.

2002-05-17  Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>
	* TcpClient.cs: fixed SetTcpClient so that
	TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient works and allows
	you to call GetStream() on its result

2002-04-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs (Poll): Give correct argument to Select(), as spotted
	by Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>
