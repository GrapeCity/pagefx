	* ResourceReader.cs (ResourceValue): Put the null resource check
	  before the resource version 2 check, this fixes bug #81757

2007-05-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs : fix for runtime serialization type index.
	  Fixed bug #81759.

2007-05-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs : temporarily disable 2.0 output until I get
	  bug #81759 fixed.

2007-05-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* IResourceWriter.cs NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute.cs
	  SatelliteContractVersionAttribute.cs ResourceManager.cs
	  IResourceReader.cs ResourceSet.cs ResourceWriter.cs
	  ResourceReader.cs UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.cs
	  MissingManifestResourceException.cs :
	  implemented 2.0 resource support (write, and remaining read bits)
	  and GetStream(). Cosmetic attributes fixes.

2007-05-25  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* MissingSatelliteAssemblyException.cs : new file.

2007-02-16  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Fixed typo.

2006-12-30  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Don't create the ResourceSets hashtable in the
	protected ctor, instead move it to the public ctors. Fixes some not
	working nunit tests. Also, return a closed ResourceSet instead of
	creating a new one. Fixes one more test. If only BaseNameField is
	provided, try to create a resource set from the BaseNameField. One
	more test that passes now.
	* ResourceSet.cs: Remove isDisposed. Not needed anymore.

2006-12-30  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Iterate through the values of the ResourceSets
	hashtable in ReleaseAllResources instead through the hashtable itself.

2006-12-30  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Support reading byte arrays in v2 resource files.
	Patch provided by Red Forks. Fixes bug #79976.

2006-10-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs, ResourceManager.cs: Calling ResourceSet.Close()
	  disposes a resource set. A closed resource set will now be
	  removed from ResourceSets. Fixes bug #79182.

2006-03-14  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Don't stop the resource set lookup until
	the invariant culture is reached. Fixes bug #77242.

2005-11-19  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Win32Resources.cs: Add a new 'FileVersion' property.

2005-07-25  Marek Safar  <marek.safar@seznam.cz>

	*  ResourceReader.cs: Implemented reading of primitives for version 2.

2005-03-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	*  ResourceReader.cs, ResourceSet.cs: Added a LinkDemand for 
	SerializationFormatter when using a Stream constructor (other ctors
	have different security - e.g. FileIOPermission for opening a file).

2005-03-22 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: use culture.Equals in InternalGetResourceSet().

2005-02-12  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: If a resource type index is -1 return null 
	instead of throwing an exception
	* ResourceWriter.cs: If an object is null; encode it with type index
	-1 instead of throwing an exception.
	
2005-02-11  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Win32Resources.cs: Fix warning.

2004-12-06  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs (InternalResourceManager): on msft, they
	search for a case-insenstitive match too here.

2004-05-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Avoid endless recursion when a resource file
	isn't found.

2004-04-08  Lluis Sanchez <lluis@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Added minor null check.

2004-02-03  Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Do not throw an exception for null strings.
	
2004-01-13  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Win32Resources.cs (Win32VersionInfoResource): Add more properties.

	* Win32Resources.cs: Fix warnings not detected by mcs.

2004-01-08  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Win32Resources.cs: Organize win32 resources into a class hierarchy
	with the class Win32Resource as the abstract superclass. Add 
	Win32ResFileReader and Win32IconFileReader classes and the 
	corresponding resource types.

	* Win32Resources.cs (Win32VersionInfoResource): Fix version number 
	calculation. Add Language property.

2004-01-05  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Win32Resources.cs: New file.

	* Win32Resources.cs: The value of properties can't be empty.

	for well-known property names. Add missing namespace declaration.

2003-12-17  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* ResourceWriter.cs (Stream): New internal property used by Ref.Emit.

2003-11-28  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Do string compares with the Invariant culture.

2003-11-18  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Implemented v1.1 updates

2003-09-07  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	can run.

2003-05-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	found. Also fixes bug #34196.

2003-05-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: enabled the code that calls GetSatelliteAssembly
	and ignore the exception thrown if the assembly cannot be loaded.

2003-05-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: fixed the name for the file when the culture is
	not de invariant culture. Commented out the GetSatelliteAssembly code
	to avoid NotImplementedException being thrown.

2002-08-19  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs: Implemented all methods

	* ResourceReader.cs: Cope with our ResourceSet class name, as well
	as theirs

2002-08-18  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Finished basic implementation.  Some
	optimisation in conjunction with ResourceSet still possible though

2002-08-14  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Throw the correct exceptions

	* ResourceManager.cs: Implemented all unfinished methods

2002-03-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* MissingManifestResourceException.cs: This should inherit from
	SystemException, not Exception.

2002-01-26  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Finsished reading resource files with just strings
	in them.  Need to figure out other types, and also resources with
	multiple types in the same file.

2002-01-24  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Implemented constructors. Started on the 
	GetEnumerator() method.  Not done yet, but comitting for 
	'disaster recovery' purposes.

2002-01-19  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* *.cs: Fixed indentation. There was a stupid bug in my .emacs file.

2002-1-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Implemented GetObject (string, bool) and GetString
	(string, bool). ResourceSet has no more MonoTODOs! Also added in the
	Serializable attribute.
	
	* *.cs: convert to Miguel's brace style.

2002-01-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed GetNeutralResourcesLanguage () and added
	new attributes documented in 1.0 SDK.

2002-01-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs: Added MonoTODO decorations.

	* SatelliteContractVersionAttribute.cs: added new attributes in 1.0 SDK.

	* NeutralResoucesLanguageAttribute.cs: added new attributes in 1.0 SDK
	
2002-01-16  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Fixed some typos.

	* ResourceManager.cs: After reading the tutorial from the SDK,
	finished all the ResourceManager constructors and removed those
	MonoTODO tags.
	
	Removed MonoTODO from GetNeutralResourcesLanguage (Assembly)
	because Miguel just implemented the whole class, including the
	constructor that I needed (CultureInfo (string)).

	Updated fields after reading the new docs from the final SDK.

	* ResXFileRef.cs, ResXResourceReader.cs: Removed. They are part of
	Windows.Forms and require System.Xml, which we don't have access to.

2002-01-13  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Added more MonoTODOs and cleaned up some 
	indenting.

2002-01-09  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed the GetSatelliteContractVersion()
	method. It was missing a cast before. Removed MonoTODO
	attribute. ;-) It was tested by John Barnette, so this shouldn't break
	the build.

	* ResourceManager.cs: Removed MonoTODO attribute on GetString
	(string), as I believe it's correct. However, GetString
	(string, CultureInfo) is definitely broken, so I'm marking it with
	MonoTODO there. I also added MonoTODO to IntenalGetResourceSet().

2002-01-06  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* Finalizing IResourceReader and IResourceWriter interfaces: 
          Added "new"-modifier to IResourceReader.GetEnumerator
	* Fixed compilation issues in other *.cs, so that the 
          System.Resources namespaces can be included in the corlib build.

2002-01-05  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs : MonoTODO attribute decoration.
	
Tue Dec 18 13:18:32 CET 2001 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* *.cs: fixed some of the compilation issues: missing
	using directives, typos.

	* ResourceSet.cs:
	First attempt, can't continue until ResourceReader and ResourceWriter are implemented.
